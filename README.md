# UniNews

A small Rust CLI to collect content from multiple sources into one local feed. Supports Atom/RSS feeds and Telegram channels, stored in a SQLite database.

Status: early alpha; behavior will evolve. The `--watch` flag is experimental.

## Features
- Single binary: `uninews`
- SQLite storage with automatic migrations
- Manage sources: add/list/remove (Atom/RSS and Telegram) with validation
- One-shot collection with experimental `--watch` mode for continuous monitoring
- Docker support with Alpine-based images
- Colorized output with enhanced error reporting
- Logging controlled by `RUST_LOG` and `DEBUG` environment variables

## Quickstart
Build the release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run commands:

```bash
./target/release/uninews --help
./target/release/uninews init
./target/release/uninews source add atom https://example.com/feed.xml
./target/release/uninews source ls
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/uninews collect
```

Alternative (no install):

```bash
cargo run -p news_cli -- --help
```

To install the binary into your PATH, see [Installation](docs/installation.md).

## Docker

UniNews supports Docker deployment with a minimal Alpine-based image.

Pull and run the official image:

```bash
docker pull zoobestik/uninews:latest
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data zoobestik/uninews:latest
```

Or use docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
